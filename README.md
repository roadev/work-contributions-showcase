# Juan David Roa Valencia - Web Development / Frontend Portfolio

## This is a WIP (Work In Progress)â€”less than 20% of the portfolio. Most projects are private, so I need permission from past employers in most cases!

## Introduction

I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with over nine years of experience in creating high-performance web applications and components. My work includes developing user-friendly interfaces and optimizing web applications for speed and scalability. Below is a selection of my web development projects, including archived web pages and GitHub repositories that showcase my expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python, and more.

### Note

This portfolio highlights my work across various companies, contributions to open-source projects, and involvement in community meetups and workshops in ReactJS, JavaScript, and Ruby. I am continuously updating this portfolio as I retrieve more information from archived websites.
